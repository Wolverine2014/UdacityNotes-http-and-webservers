Course notes jotted down while taking the ["HTTP & Web Servers"](https://www.udacity.com/course/http-web-servers--ud303) course on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) as part of the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree v4.0](https://in.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004/)

These notes have been made in an effort to increase my own understanding of the course concepts, to act as a quick reference for the future, and to act as supplementary material for others taking this course or a similar one.

The language has been kept simple and there are links at the bottom of every section to aid clarification and further independent exploration of topics.

### Options for Accessing Notes

The notes have been written in Markdown and there are multiple ways to view them:

#### 1. Right Here! :point_down:
Github's Markdown viewer renders `.md` files flawlessly so you can just click on the files and view them here itself. However, this may be a little restrictive since you can't directly take proper print outs or might not find the UI appealing enough for reading long files.

#### 2. Markdown Editor :book:

I personally use **[Atom](https://atom.io/)** to edit and view Markdown files with the [Markdown Preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview) package installed, but there are many other editors with live preview you can choose from.

**[Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/)** and **[StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)** are in-browser editors which allow you to import a `.md` file or paste in it's text, view it and export it in various file formats, including PDF.

Alternatively, you can find an exhaustive list of Markdown editors [here](http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/#h_KoCE75yZqh).

#### 3. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) :computer:

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) is a very powerful and extremely simple to use command line based tool for converting one file to another. Converting a the notes from Markdown to PDF in Pandoc would be as simple as
```
pandoc requests-&-responses.md -s -o requests-&-responses.pdf
```

If you find a mistake please mention it in the issues! Fork for spinning up your own versions!  

Enjoy learning! :sunny:
